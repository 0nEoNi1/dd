Fooocus is an image generating software that allows you to focus on your prompts and generated contents.

Fooocus is also a rethinking of Stable Diffusion’s merits and Midjourney’s design principles:

* Learned from Stable Diffusion, the Fooocus is offline, open source, and free.

* Learned from Midjourney, the Fooocus only have one textbox, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.
